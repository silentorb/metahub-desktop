# MetaHub Desktop

## Overview

* This project is an experiment that may not pan out
* The goal is to create a decentralized documentation app that can accurately and agilely model complex domains
* This is an attempt in a series of failed attempts spanning over a decade

## Vision and Goals

* Get back to some of the core principles of the World Wide Web, namely documents that are:
  * Cross-linked
  * Decentralized
  * Easy to navigate and query
* Empower cleanly organizing information spanning multiple domains and dimensions
* Empower users to easily generate, modify, navigate, and query that information
* Initially focus on personal information management
* Have a permissive open source license
* Be Git friendly
* Store data locally as Markdown/JSON/YAML
* Employ robust information architecture principles
* Reuse existing technologies as much as possible, even if that means omitting some advanced features

## Feature Roadmap

### V1 - June 2022

* Windows desktop app
* Embedded Markdown Editor

## Motivation

> All my life I have pursued absurdly ambitious goals spanning too many dimensions.  I am not a naturally organized person, but my drive and the demands of my goals have forced me to become organized.  My personal tooling needs have always stretched current tools to the snapping point.
>
> Information tooling over-focuses on collaboration because that is where the money is.  There are frontiers that, once tamed, would benefit collaboration-focused tooling, but those frontiers are more practically explored through oft-ignored personal tooling.
>
> My perceived needs may be impractical.  They are definitely a niche.  But all of my failed attempts have provided the small insight that somewhere between the present and where I've been striving is a product that would be useful to many people. - Christopher W. Johnson
