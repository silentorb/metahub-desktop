# MetaHub Desktop

## Overview

* This project is an experiment that may not pan out
* The goal is to create a decentralized documentation app that can accurately and agilely model complex domains
* This is an attempt in a series of failed attempts spanning over a decade

## Vision and Goals

* Get back to some of the core principles of the World Wide Web, namely documents that are:
  * Cross-linked
  * Decentralized
  * Easy to navigate and query
* Empower cleanly organizing information spanning multiple domains and dimensions
* Empower users to easily generate, modify, navigate, and query that information
* Initially focus on personal information management
* Have a permissive open source license
* Be Git friendly
* Store data locally as Markdown/JSON/YAML
* Employ robust information architecture principles
* Reuse existing technologies as much as possible, even if that means omitting some advanced features
